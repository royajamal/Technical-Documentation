          <p><span>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML</span> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
          <p>HTML code example: *</p>
          <code> < p > this a paragraph element in HTML < /p > </p></code>
          <p><span>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>CSS code example: *</p>
          <code> p { text - align: is the CSS selector applied to align text of the paragraph element } </code>

      <section id="JavaScript" class="main-section">
          <header>JavaScript</header>
          <p><span>JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
          <p>JS code example: *</p>
          <code> function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code>

         <header>Python</header>
         <p><span>Python</span> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
         <p>Python code example: *</p>
         <code> print('Hello, world!') </code>

     <section id="React" class="main-section">
         <header>React</header>
         <p><span>React</span> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>
         <p>React code example: *</p>
         <code> const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
          root.render(< h1 >Hello, world!< /h1 >); </code>

     <section id="APIs" class="main-section">
         <header>APIs</header>
         <p>An <span>Application Programming Interface (API)</span> is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.</p>
